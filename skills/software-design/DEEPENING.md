# Deepening: dependencies, seams, and tests

This file uses the vocabulary of [MODULE-DESIGN.md](MODULE-DESIGN.md). MODULE-DESIGN.md decides whether a deepening, merging shallow modules behind one deeper interface, improves the design; this file decides how the chosen design is implemented and tested given its dependencies.

## Dependency categories

Sort every dependency of the candidate module into one of four categories. Each category fixes two verdicts: whether the seam gets a port or stays internal, and what the test supplies there.

- **Pure computation.** In-process work with no I/O: parsing a query string, pricing a cart under tax rules, diffing two trees. The seam stays internal and the test supplies nothing; call the interface with inputs and check outputs.
- **Locally substitutable.** A real dependency with an equivalent that runs inside the test process: a relational store that also runs embedded, a filesystem pointed at a temporary directory, a clock read through one call. The seam stays internal and the test supplies a local substitute, so the production code path runs unchanged against it. Prefer this category over a port whenever a substitute exists, because the test then exercises the dependency's real behavior.
- **Owned remote.** A system your team controls, reached across a network: a rate limiter you deploy, an internal ledger, a worker pool behind a queue. Put a port at the seam and keep the logic in the deep module; a production adapter carries the transport (client, serialization, retry and timeout policy); a test adapter satisfies the same port in memory. The logic stays in one deep module although its deployment spans the network, and the tests exercise it without a socket.
- **Foreign.** A vendor system outside your control: a payment processor, a mapping provider, a mail relay. Place a port at the seam, sized to what the module needs rather than to the vendor's surface. The production adapter parses the vendor's representation and errors into the port's terms; the test adapter answers in those terms, including every failure mode the module must handle. Checking the production adapter against the live vendor is a separate contract check, outside the module's tests.

## Seam discipline

- A port is justified by the two-adapter rule, and production plus test are the usual two. When a local substitute would serve in place of the test adapter, the substitute wins and the seam stays internal.
- A module has one external seam, its interface. Seams inside the implementation are internal; tests may inject a test adapter or local substitute at an internal seam and observe results only through the external interface.
- An internal seam enters the interface only when a production caller needs to choose the adapter. Wire the test adapter where the module is assembled and keep the port out of the operations callers invoke.

## Testing after a deepening

- New tests sit at the deepened module's interface and assert observable results: return values, state readable through the interface, and effects that arrive at an adapter through a port.
- Once interface-level tests cover the same behavior, identify tests of the merged shallow modules for retirement through `test-quality`'s [deletion gate](skill://test-quality). Aim to replace coverage rather than layer it. Any survivor that fails on an implementation-only change was pinned to the implementation: rewrite it against the interface when test edits are in scope, or identify it for removal through that gate.

The dependency question is settled only when every dependency of the candidate has a category, each seam has its port-or-internal verdict and its named test adapter or local substitute, and the new, rewritten, and retired tests and deferred retirement candidates are listed. Deferred removals do not block completion.
